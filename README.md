## Installation

You can install the package with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) using the following command:

```bash
composer require imliam/laravel-env-set-command
```

## Usage

When running the `env:set` artisan command, you must provide both a key and value as two arguments.

```bash
$ php artisan env:set app_name Example
# Environment variable with key 'APP_NAME' has been changed from 'Laravel' to 'Example'
```

You can also set values with spaces by wrapping them in quotes.

```bash
$ php artisan env:set app_name "Example App"
# Environment variable with key 'APP_NAME' has been changed from 'Laravel' to '"Example App"'
```

The command will also create new environment variables if an existing one does not exist.

```bash
$ php artisan env:set editor=vscode
# A new environment variable with key 'EDITOR' has been set to 'vscode'
```

Instead of two arguments split by a space, you can also mimic the `.env` file format by supplying `KEY=VALUE`.

```bash
$ php artisan env:set app_name=Example
# Environment variable with key 'APP_NAME' has been changed from 'Laravel' to 'Example'
```

The command will do its best to stop any invalid inputs.

```bash
$ php artisan env:set @pp_n@me Laravel
# Invalid environment key @pp_n@me! Only use letters and underscores
```

You can specify the external `.env` file in the third optional argument.

```bash
$ php artisan env:set APP_NAME TestApp /var/www/my_own_env.env
# Environment variable with key 'APP_NAME' has been changed from 'Laravel' to 'TestApp'
```

Or in the second parameter if you use key=value syntax.
```bash
$ php artisan env:set APP_NAME=TestApp /var/www/my_own_env.env
# Environment variable with key 'APP_NAME' has been changed from 'Laravel' to 'TestApp'
```
